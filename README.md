# LoginXplorer
This project is a part of project submission for LoginXplorer
This project is based on survey of employees, in which we connect our data to the JsonPoweredDB through the connection token.
First I registered on account developer on JPDB, and then I have generated a connection token , by using that connection token I connect the database to html webpage.
I have created a web page name Employee Survey Details through which I have insert the details of employee, like employee id, employee name, employee department in which I have given 5 options in which we have to choose one and then employee salary and last employee email id.
I have created a web page name retrieve data from which I can retrive data of the employee.
I also have created a web page name update data from which I can update or change the details of any employee.
I have created a web page name deletedata using that web page I can remove the details of any employee.
all the data is stored on JPDB.
